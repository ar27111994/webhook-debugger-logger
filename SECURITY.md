## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT start a public issue.

Instead, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/ar27111994/webhook-debugger-logger/security/advisories/new) or email <security@apify.com> if you believe it affects the underlying platform.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.
