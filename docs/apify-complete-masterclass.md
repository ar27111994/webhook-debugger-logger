## IDEA #1: Webhook Debugger & Logger ⭐ LAUNCH FIRST

### Why This Idea?
- **Fastest to build**: 3-4 days to production
- **Highest immediate appeal**: Every developer needs this
- **Easiest user acquisition**: High organic search volume
- **Standby mode ready**: Perfect for real-time webhook serving
- **Quality score boost**: Natural high ratings from utility

### The Problem You're Solving
Developers waste 5+ hours debugging webhook integrations. Problems:
- Can't see what data is being sent
- No way to test webhooks locally
- Webhook timeouts cause lost data
- Debugging requires complex setup

### Detailed Solution

**User Flow**:
1. Developer runs Actor
2. Gets 3 unique, temporary webhook URLs
3. Configures their app to send to these URLs
4. Actor logs every request with full headers/body/query params
5. Developer sees logs in real-time or via API
6. Exports logs as JSON/CSV when done

**Key Features**:
- Generate 1-10 unique webhook URLs per run
- Configurable TTL (1-72 hours, default 24)
- Capture request metadata: timestamp, size, latency
- Support different content types (JSON, form, XML)
- Payload size limits (10MB max, configurable)
- Automatic cleanup after TTL expires

**Monetization Structure**:
- **Event**: Each webhook request logged = 1 PPE event
- **Pricing**: $0.01-0.02 per event
- **Typical Usage**: 50 events/session × 50 MAU × 2 sessions/month = $50 revenue
- **Scale Path**: 500 MAU = $500/month revenue

### Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1 (MVP - Days 1-3)**:
- Set up Apify Node.js template
- Build HTTP server (Express.js)
- Implement webhook URL generation (unique IDs)
- Store requests in Apify dataset
- Basic JSON export
- **Quality Target**: 65+

**Week 1 (Enhancement - Days 3-4)**:
- Add CSV export
- Implement TTL auto-cleanup
- Add filtering (by timestamp, status code, content-type)
- Create comprehensive README with examples
- Add error handling
- **Quality Target**: 70+

**Week 2 (Polish)**:
- Optimize Standby mode performance
- Add real-time event streaming
- Integrate with Zapier/Make for distribution
- Record demo video (2 min walkthrough)
- **Final Quality Target**: 75+

### Antigravity Agent Prompt (Ready-to-Use)

1. ARCHITECTURE:
   - Use Apify Standby mode to keep Actor warm for HTTP requests
   - Use Express.js as HTTP server
   - Generate unique webhook IDs on startup
   - Automatically cleanup after TTL

2. INPUT SCHEMA:
   - urlCount: number (1-10 URLs to generate, default: 3)
   - retentionHours: number (1-72, default: 24)
   - maxPayloadSize: number (bytes, default: 10485760 = 10MB)
   - enableJSONParsing: boolean (default: true)

3. OUTPUT:
   - Generate dataset with webhook events
   - Each event includes:
     * timestamp (ISO 8601)
     * webhookId (which URL was hit)
     * method (GET, POST, etc.)
     * headers (full object)
     * query (query parameters)

4. ENDPOINT:
   - POST/GET /webhook/:id
   - Validate webhookId format
   - Parse different content types
   - Return 200 OK immediately
   - Log asynchronously

5. CLEANUP:
   - Track request timestamps in Actor state
   - Delete expired webhooks after TTL
   - Clean up dataset entries older than TTL

6. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Invalid webhook ID → 404
   - Payload too large → 413
   - Malformed content → log as-is, 200 OK
   - Network errors → graceful logging

7. TECH STACK:
   - Framework: Apify SDK (Node.js)
   - HTTP: Express.js
   - Parsing: body-parser, express-json
   - Storage: Apify dataset + actor state

8. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
   - Input/output schemas fully documented
   - README with 5+ curl/Postman examples
   - Error messages helpful and clear
   - Performance: <100ms per request
   - Test with large payloads (10MB)
   - Actor Quality target: 75+

BUILD PROCESS:
1. Start with Express.js setup + Standby mode
2. Implement webhook URL generation + tracking
3. Add request logging logic
4. Implement TTL cleanup
5. Add error handling
6. Write comprehensive README

This should take 3-4 days total. Build iteratively and test thoroughly.

# GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

## Why Google Antigravity?

**Cost**: Free public preview (no investment)  
**Speed**: Build 5+ Actors in 8 weeks with AI assistance  
**Quality**: Gemini 3 Pro handles complex coding tasks  
**Integration**: Works seamlessly with Apify SDK  
**Scaling**: Multi-agent orchestration for complex projects

## The Antigravity Workflow for Actor Development

### Step 1: Planning Phase (Agent-Assisted)

**Your Input to Antigravity**:
```
I'm building an Apify Actor called "Webhook Debugger."
- Users need temporary webhook URLs for testing
- Must log all incoming requests with full details
- Should auto-cleanup after 24-72 hours
- Target Actor Quality Score: 75+

Create a detailed implementation plan with:
1. Architecture overview
2. Technology choices
3. File structure
4. Step-by-step tasks
5. Testing strategy
```

**What Antigravity Returns**:
- Structured task breakdown (10-15 tasks)
- Technology recommendations
- Architecture diagram (visual)
- Estimated timeline
- Potential blockers + solutions

### Step 2: Code Generation Phase

**Your Input**:
```
Using the plan we created, generate the Express.js HTTP server 
for the Webhook Debugger. Include:
- Webhook ID generation (UUID)
- Request logging to Apify dataset
- Error handling
- Comprehensive comments
- Unit tests

Target: Production-ready code, not skeleton.
```

**What You Get**:
- Complete server implementation
- Automated tests
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations

### Step 3: Iteration & Refinement

**Example Refinement**:
```
The code looks great. Now:
1. Add TTL-based cleanup (remove webhooks after retention period)
2. Implement CSV export in addition to JSON
3. Add request filtering (by timestamp, status code)
4. Create comprehensive README with 5+ examples
5. Add error messages for edge cases

Keep code production-ready and well-documented.
```

### Step 4: Quality Optimization

**Your Input**:
```
Help me optimize this Actor for quality score. Generate:
1. Better error messages (currently cryptic)
2. Input schema improvements with better descriptions
3. README sections for "Common Issues" + "Troubleshooting"
4. Performance optimizations (reduce compute units)
5. Additional inline code comments

Target: 75+ quality score.
```

## Antigravity Prompting Best Practices

### DO ✅

**1. Be Specific**
```
✅ DO: "Create a Node.js Express server with 3 endpoints: 
   POST /webhook/log (accepts any JSON), 
   GET /webhook/logs (returns paginated results), 
   DELETE /webhook/:id (removes webhook)."

❌ DON'T: "Build a webhook handler"
```

**2. Define Constraints**
```
✅ DO: "Max payload size: 10MB. Max webhook URLs: 10. 
   Response time target: <100ms per request."

❌ DON'T: "Make it fast"
```

**3. Specify Technology Stack**
```
✅ DO: "Use Express.js for HTTP, Apify SDK for storage, 
   uuid library for ID generation, Apify dataset for logging."

❌ DON'T: "Build an HTTP server"
```

**4. Include Quality Requirements**
```
✅ DO: "Comprehensive error handling. 
   Logging for debugging. Unit tests for core functions. 
   Actor Quality target: 75+. Minimal dependencies."

❌ DON'T: "Make sure it works"
```

**5. Break Down Complexity**
```
✅ DO: "Phase 1 (Day 1): HTTP server + webhook logging
         Phase 2 (Day 2): TTL cleanup + CSV export
         Phase 3 (Day 3): Error handling + README"

❌ DON'T: "Build the whole thing at once"
```

### DON'T ❌

**1. Vague Goals**
- ❌ "Build a scraper"
- ✅ "Build a Node.js web scraper using Cheerio that extracts product names, prices, and URLs from Amazon search results"

**2. Skip Error Handling**
- ❌ "Just make it work"
- ✅ "Include error handling for network timeouts (retry 3x with exponential backoff), invalid input (return 400 with helpful message), and rate limiting (queue requests)"

**3. Ignore Documentation**
- ❌ "Code is self-explanatory"
- ✅ "Include JSDoc comments for all functions, comprehensive README with 3+ input/output examples, and troubleshooting section"

**4. Forget About Testing**
- ❌ "We'll test manually"
- ✅ "Include unit tests for core logic, integration tests for API calls, and edge case tests (empty input, max payload, etc.)"

**5. Overspecify Implementation**
- ❌ "Use this exact package version..."
- ✅ "Use latest stable axios (for HTTP), uuid (for ID generation), express (for HTTP server). Include package-lock.json for reproducibility"

## Sample Antigravity Workflow (Complete Example)

### Initial Prompt

```
I'm building an Apify Actor called "Email Validator & Enricher" for the 
Apify $1M Challenge.

OBJECTIVE:
Validate email addresses and enrich them with B2B company data (Hunter.io, 
Clearbit) for sales teams.

KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- Input: CSV/JSON with email addresses
- Output: Validated emails with company data + confidence scores
- Batch processing: 500+ emails at once
- Enrichment APIs: Hunter.io, Clearbit (user provides API keys)
- Quality target: 75+ quality score

Create a detailed implementation plan including:
1. Architecture (how data flows)
2. Technology stack (libraries, APIs)
3. File structure
4. 15-step task breakdown
5. Potential challenges + solutions
6. Estimated timeline

Be very specific and production-oriented.
```

### Refinement Prompt 1 (After reviewing plan)

```
Great plan! Now generate the core validation logic:

1. Email format validation (RFC 5322)
2. DNS MX record checking
3. Disposable domain detection
4. Catch-all address detection

Include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed JSDoc comments
- Unit tests for each validation type
- Performance optimizations (caching, batching)

Code should be production-ready, not skeleton.
```

### Refinement Prompt 2 (Enrichment layer)

```
Now add the enrichment layer:

1. Hunter.io API integration (find company from email domain)
2. Clearbit API integration (get company details: industry, size, etc.)
3. Caching layer (avoid redundant API calls)
4. Rate limiting (handle API quotas)
5. Fallback logic (if API fails, return partial data)

Include:
- Error messages (helpful, not cryptic)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Budget tracking (show user their API usage)
- Comprehensive comments

Make it production-ready.
```

### Refinement Prompt 3 (Quality optimization)

```
Help me optimize for Actor Quality Score. Generate:

1. Improved input/output schemas with better descriptions
2. Comprehensive README with:
   - What it does / why use it (with keyword optimization)
   - Input examples (screenshots or JSON)
   - Output examples (CSV format shown)
   - Setup instructions (API key configuration)
   - Troubleshooting section
   - FAQ addressing common questions
3. Better error messages (replace cryptic codes with helpful text)
4. Performance improvements (reduce compute unit usage)
5. Edge case handling (empty input, large batches, API failures)

Target: 75+ quality score. Include tips on what Apify quality scoring 
system looks for.
```

- Show risk flags being empty (good quality data)
- Include 2-3 complete examples

### 6. How to Get Started (Quick Start)

**Purpose**: Make first run dead simple

```markdown
## How to get started

**Step 1**: Prepare your email list (CSV or JSON)

**Step 2**: Open Actor input and paste your emails:
```json
{
  "emails": ["email1@example.com", "email2@example.com"],
  "enrichment": "full"
}
```

**Step 3**: Click "Start" to run

**Step 4**: Wait 2-5 minutes (depending on email count)

**Step 5**: Download results as CSV or JSON

**Optional**: For company enrichment, provide Hunter.io + Clearbit API keys
```

**Best Practices**:
- Step-by-step (numbered, not bullets)
- Include screenshot of each step
- Show expected results for each step
- Mention optional configurations (API keys)

### 7. Pricing Explained (Transparency = Trust)

**Purpose**: Explain PPE pricing clearly (remove doubt)

```markdown
## How much does it cost?

This Actor uses **pay-per-event pricing**, meaning you only pay for 
what you use:

- **$0.03 per email validated** (when enriched)
- Batch: 100 emails = $3
- Batch: 1,000 emails = $30

**Examples**:
- Weekly list validation: 500 emails × $0.03 = $15/week
- Monthly campaign: 10,000 emails × $0.03 = $300/month
- No setup fees, no minimum commitment

**Compare to alternatives**:
- ZeroBounce: $0.10/email + $99/month subscription
- Clearbit: $30/month minimum + $0.50/record
- This Actor: **Pay only for what you use**
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use pay-per-event (builds trust)
- Show concrete examples
- Compare to expensive alternatives (anchoring effect)
- Emphasize "no subscription" (psychological advantage)
- Use bold for prices (psychological pricing)

### 8. Advanced Features / Tips (For Power Users)

**Purpose**: Show depth for technical users

```markdown
## Advanced features & tips

**Batch processing (10,000+ emails)**:
Set `batchSize` to 100 for parallel processing. Reduces runtime 50-70%.

**Use your own API keys**:
Provide Hunter.io + Clearbit API keys for unlimited enrichment.
`{"apiKeys": {"hunterIo": "...", "clearbit": "..."}}`

**Caching strategy**:
Results are cached by domain. Validating multiple emails from 
same company uses cache (faster + cheaper).

**Export to Google Sheets**:
Set `exportToSheets` with Sheet URL to auto-populate results.

**CI/CD Integration**:
Integrate with n8n or Zapier to auto-validate leads from CRM.
```

**Best Practices**:
- Include power-user features
- Explain how to save money (caching, batch processing)
- Show integration options (Zapier, n8n, Google Sheets)
- Include code snippets for technical users

### 9. FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Purpose**: Answer common questions pre-emptively (reduce support load)

```markdown
## Frequently asked questions

**Q: How accurate is the validation?**
A: Email format validation (99.9% accurate). DNS verification (95%+ 
accurate). Some deliverability checks require SMTP verification 
(more accurate but slower).

**Q: Can I use this for email marketing?**
A: Yes! Results work great for cold outreach. Validated emails = 
higher deliverability rates.

**Q: Do you store my email data?**
A: No. Emails are processed and discarded. Only result metadata is 
stored in your dataset (you own this data).

**Q: How often should I re-validate?**
A: Every 6 months. Email addresses expire at ~2% per month.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Invalid API key"
**Solution**: Double-check Hunter.io key in input. Regenerate if needed.

**Issue**: "Request timed out"
**Solution**: Reduce batch size. Try 100 emails instead of 1000.

**Issue**: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: Your API key hit hourly limits. Wait 1 hour or upgrade plan.
```

**Best Practices**:
- Answer most common questions (from support tickets)
- Include troubleshooting for common errors
- Provide specific solutions (not just "try again")
- Link to docs/support where appropriate

---

# MONETIZATION PSYCHOLOGY & PRICING STRATEGY

## Understanding PPE Psychology

**Why PPE Converts Better**:

1. **Perceived Fairness** (Transparency effect)
   - "I only pay for what I use" → psychological advantage
   - Removes risk → higher conversion
   - Builds trust → positive reviews

2. **Lower Perceived Cost** (Anchoring effect)
   - Charging $0.01 per event feels cheaper than $10/month
   - User mentally calculates: "50 events = $0.50"
   - But with 500 MAU × 50 events/month = $250, you earn $250

3. **Activation Barrier** (Friction reduction)
   - No credit card required for free tier trial
   - Free initial runs → user becomes invested
   - Low switching cost → high adoption

---

## Pricing Your Actor (Psychological Framework)

### Step 1: Calculate Your COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

**Example - Email Validator**:
- Apify compute cost: $0.003 per run
- Hunter.io API: $0.01 per lookup
- Clearbit API: $0.005 per lookup
- Other costs: $0.002 per run

**Total COGS**: $0.02 per email validated

**Recommended Pricing**: $0.03-0.05 per email (150-250% markup)

### Step 2: Price Based on Market Benchmarks

**Research Your Competitors**:
- Don't price below market (signals low quality)
- Don't price significantly above (kills adoption)
- Price at 80-90% of best competitor (perceived value + discount feeling)

**Example**:
- ZeroBounce: $0.10/email
- NeverBounce: $0.08/email
- **Your Actor**: $0.03-0.05/email (30-50% cheaper perception)

### Step 3: Psychological Pricing Tactics

#### Charm Pricing (The "Just Below" Effect)

**❌ Don't**: $0.10 per event  
**✅ Do**: $0.099 per event

Why it works:
- Our brains process the first digit ($0.0*X*)
- $0.099 feels significantly cheaper than $0.10
- Psychological impact: 5-15% higher conversion

#### Tiered Pricing (The "Anchor" Effect)

```
Basic Plan (Starter):
- 100 emails/month: $5.99

Professional Plan (Recommended):
- 1,000 emails/month: $49.99  ← Anchor (shows value)
- $0.05/email (middle tier)

Enterprise Plan (Premium):
- 10,000 emails/month: $399.99
- $0.04/email (bulk discount)
```

Why this works:
- Middle tier anchors perception (looks like best value)
- Premium tier justifies price (people see savings)
- Users gravitate toward middle tier (psychology of moderation)

#### Volume Discounts (The "Sunk Cost" Effect)

```
Usage Tier Discounts:
- First 100 events: $0.05 each = $5
- 101-500 events: $0.04 each
- 501-1000 events: $0.03 each
- 1000+ events: $0.02 each
```

Why it works:
- "I'm already at 400 events, might as well do 500" (sunk cost bias)
- Users feel they're getting a deal
- Increases average order value 20-40%

---

## Pricing Psychology Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Be Transparent**
   - Show exact pricing formula
   - No hidden fees
   - Clear when user pays (builds trust)

2. **Use Precise Numbers**
   - $0.099 instead of $0.10 (charm pricing)
   - $49.99 instead of $50 (odd-even pricing)
   - Psychologically impacts 10-20% conversion change

3. **Offer Tiered Options**
   - Low (for price-sensitive)
   - Medium (for most users - design this to be "obvious choice")
   - High (for power users)

4. **Test & Iterate**
   - A/B test $0.02 vs $0.03 vs $0.05
   - Track conversion rate changes
   - Adjust based on real data

5. **Emphasize Savings**
   - "Save $50/month vs. ZeroBounce"
   - "10x cheaper than NeverBounce"
   - Anchoring to expensive alternatives

### DON'T ❌

1. **Hidden Fees**
   - Reduces trust (review killer)
   - Triggers churn immediately
   - Can cause disqualification

2. **Complex Pricing**
   - 5+ tiers confuses users
   - Decision fatigue → abandonment
   - Keep to 2-3 clear tiers maximum

3. **Underpricing**
   - Signals low quality
   - Kills brand perception
   - Unsustainable business model

4. **Changing Prices Randomly**
   - Existing users feel cheated
   - Trust erosion
   - Review impact (negative)

5. **Offering "Free" Forever**
   - Unsustainable
   - Attracts wrong audience (non-paying)
   - Can't scale

---

## Pricing by Actor Type (Ready-to-Use)

### Data Processing Actors (Email Validator, Price Monitor)
```
Low Volume: $0.01-0.02 per event
Medium Volume: $0.03-0.05 per event
High Volume: $0.05-0.10 per event

Example: Email Validator
- $0.04 per email (baseline)
- 300 MAU × 100 emails/month × $0.04 = $1,200/month
- $2,000 challenge bonus at 1,000+ MAU
```

### API Wrappers (Scheduler, Rate Limiter)
```
Low Volume: $0.005-0.01 per event
Medium Volume: $0.01-0.02 per event
High Volume: $0.02-0.05 per event

Example: Social Scheduler
- $0.07 per post (to 4 platforms)
- 400 MAU × 2 posts/day × 30 days × $0.07 = $1,680/month
- Potential: $2,000+ challenge bonus
```

### AI/Analysis Tools (Sentiment Analyzer, Doc Generator)
```
Low Volume: $0.50-1.00 per event
Medium Volume: $1.00-2.00 per event
High Volume: $2.00-5.00 per event

Example: Sentiment Analyzer
- $1.50 per brand analysis
- 250 MAU × 4 analyses/month × $1.50 = $1,500/month
- Potential: $2,000 challenge bonus
```
