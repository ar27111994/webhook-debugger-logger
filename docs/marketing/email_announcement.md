# Subject: 🚀 Launching Webhook Debugger v3.0 - The Ultimate Testing Tool

Hi [Name],

I'm excited to share that **Webhook Debugger & Logger v3.0** is now live on the Apify Store!

If you've ever struggled with debugging webhooks from Stripe, Shopify, or GitHub, this tool is for you. We've rebuilt the core architecture to be faster, safer, and more extensible.

### What's New in v3.0?

- **⚡ Sub-10ms Latency**: Optimized for Apify Standby Mode.
- **🛡️ Enterprise Security**: IP whitelisting, API keys, and SSRF protection.
- **🔄 Hot Reloading**: Update settings on the fly without restarts.
- **📜 Real-Time Logs**: Stream logs directly to your terminal or dashboard.
- **🧱 OOP Architecture**: A completely refactored codebase for reliability.

### Use Cases

1.  **Stripe Integration**: Verify signatures and replay failed payment events.
2.  **AI Agents**: Connect via MCP to let AI verify your webhooks.
3.  **Local Dev**: Forward webhooks to localhost without ngrok.
