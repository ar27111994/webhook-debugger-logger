# 📈 Zero-Cost Growth & Monitoring Guide

Implement these high-leverage, low-effort strategies to find users exactly when they are experiencing webhook pain.

## 1. Automated "Webhook Pain" Monitoring

Don't sit online 24/7. Use automation to alert you when folks are stuck.

- **High-Intent Keywords (Google Alerts / Pulse)**:
  - `"webhook debugger online"`
  - `"ngrok alternatives for webhooks"`
  - `"inspect stripe webhook body"`
  - `"shopify webhook 429 error"`
  - `"slack interactive component payload logger"`
  - `"hookdeck vs [competitor]"`
- **Stack Overflow Monitoring**: Use Pulse to track tags: `webhook`, `stripe-webhooks`, `shopify-api`.

## 2. Low-Effort Distribution Funnel

Implement a "Value First" funnel that costs $0/mo.

- **The Reddit "Bridge"**:
  - **Identify**: Someone complaining about local tunnel timeouts or missing data.
  - **Respond**: "I had this issue with Stripe. I used this free debugger to bridge it: [URL]. It keeps logs for 72h so you don't lose events."
- **The SEO Long-tail**:
  - Publish the playbooks in this repo as GitHub Gists or Dev.to posts.
  - Title: "How to survive Shopify Launch Week: Webhook Hardening 101."

## 3. Lightweight Monitoring (PostHog Free Tier)

Track user intent without complex analytics.

- **Event Tracking**: Track clicks on "Launch Webhook Debugger" links using UTM parameters.
  - `?utm_source=playbook&utm_medium=stripe`
- **Funnel Analysis**: See which playbooks drive the most "Try it" clicks to decide where to build more features.

## 4. Reddit Response Templates

| Scenario           | Response Hook                                                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tunnel Timeout** | "If ngrok is timing out, try bridging via Apify. It responds in <10ms and buffers the payloads for you."      |
| **Missing Data**   | "Webhook data missing? Use a logger that captures the raw raw body before your app parses it."                |
| **Mocking Needs**  | "You can mock the 400/500 responses from the webhook provider to test your retry logic without code changes." |
